/// The `DeleteBounces` class represents the API call to [delete from the
/// bounce list](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/bounces.html#Delete-bounces-DELETE).
/// You can use it to delete the entire list, or specific entries from the
/// list.
///
/// ## Delete All Bounces
///
/// To delete all bounces, use the request returned from
/// `DeleteBounces.all`.  This request will delete all bounces on your
/// bounce list.
///
/// ```swift
/// do {
///     let request = DeleteBounces.all
///     try Session.shared.send(request: request) { result in
///         switch result {
///         case .success(let response):
///             print(response.statusCode)
///         case .failure(let err):
///             print(err)
///         }
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Delete Specific Bounces
///
/// To delete specific entries from your bounce list, use the
/// `DeleteBounces` class. You can either specify email addresses (as
/// strings), or you can use `Bounce` instances (useful for if you just retrieved
/// some from the `RetrieveBounces` class).
///
/// ```swift
/// do {
///     let request = DeleteBounces(emails: "foo@example.none", "bar@example.none")
///     try Session.shared.send(request: request) { result in
///         switch result {
///         case .success(let response):
///             print(response.statusCode)
///         case .failure(let err):
///             print(err)
///         }
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
